# TFF
This is a Taipei food-related web app I built for an Independent Project class my junior year.
It is a very basic web application built with Flask, Python and PostgreSQL.
Aside from the application, there is a script I built on the side meant to scrape information from Google Places API and stores it in your PostgreSQL database.

Features include: 
* basic login and register
* like/unlike restaurants
* basic search engine
